**Description:** 

I am creating a ReactNative-based blog website tailored for my church's media team. The primary goal of this project is to foster user engagement by providing a platform where visitors can seamlessly watch videos, share their thoughts through comments, and actively interact with the site's content. To achieve this, I'll be leveraging React JS to craft dynamic and interactive user interfaces for the web platform. Additionally, I plan to utilize React Native for the development of the mobile application, ensuring a consistent and optimized experience across various devices.

**MVP Goals:**
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on implementing a homepage that displays  featured videos from the church's media team. Include a section for recent blog posts. Provide easy navigation to different sections of the website. Allow users to play videos directly on the website. Display recent blog posts with titles and brief excerpts. Allow users to click on a post to read the full content. Include a comment section for users to leave feedback or thoughts. Enable users to leave comments on both videos and blog posts. Include basic moderation features to manage comments (e.g., approve, delete). Ensure the website is accessible and usable across various devices and screen sizes. Implement a mobile-first approach to prioritize mobile user experience. Provide an interface for the church's media team to manage content. Allow admins to upload new videos, create blog posts, and moderate comments.
